# Introduction-to-Data-Structures

This repository contains the project I was asked to complete for our Introduction-to-Data-Structures course. Everything that is needed to run the code is available and the user will be prompted via the command prompt with several options. To read more about the specifications and how the code works, please checkout the "HW4F2021.pdf" file.
